## Purpose:

    Translate performance-critical Python code to C++ for seamless integration and optimized execution within a self-driving car architecture.

## Why we want to do that?
    Performance and Speed
    Real-time decision making: Self-driving cars rely on split-second decisions based on sensor data (cameras, LiDAR, etc.). Python, while great for prototyping, can be slower than C++. C++'s compiled nature and fine-grained control over memory make it ideal for these time-sensitive tasks.

## Trade-off, how to pick the right solutions?

    C++ is faster to run but longer to develop. python on the other hand is slower to run but faster to develop. We always have to make a choice, what's the most important for us
